github push -


step 1 : git add .
step 2 : git commit -m "relevant message or specific component"
step 3 : git push origin main . If any error try this  => (git push -f origin main )



github pull -

First if you want any team members code to re-check or analyze

then use this => git pull origin main


But If you want to work on the final result then use this 
command to get the code on your local device

git pull origin master
